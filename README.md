# jsonshell

Navigating JSON documents just got a whole lot easier! With `jsonshell`, you can navigate large and complex documents as if they were in a shell-like environment. In
`jsonshell`, objects are treated as directories and can be navigated through with the `cd` command. You can also use the `ls` command, which lists all the
keys/property names, `lsr` (which is just ls but recursive), `get` which retrives a value by key/property name, and more! 

In the future I hope to implement navigating into objects within lists/arrays, and I also hope to add commands that are able to edit the document.
