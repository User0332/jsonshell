# jsonshell

Navigating JSON documents just got a whole lot easier! With `jsonshell`, you can navigate large and complex objects as if they were in a shell-like environment. In
`jsonshell`, objects are treated as directories and can be navigated through with the `cd` command. You can also use the `ls` command, which lists all the
keys/property names,  `get` which retrives a value by key/property name, and more!

Install it with `pip install jsonshell`, and then run either `jsonsh` or `json.sh`. Pass in the JSON object filename as the argument to `json.sh`, and then use the `help` command to get started!
